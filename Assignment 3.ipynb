    "    Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user.\n",
    "    This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages.\n",
    "    That enables the user to implement even more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or,\n",
    "    even thinking about all the hidden background/back-end complexity.\n",

    "    Example: When we use the TV remote to increase the volume. \n",
